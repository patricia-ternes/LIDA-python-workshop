## General solution

> To speed up any Python code four steps can be followed:

1. Before moving on to more advanced techniques, it is recommended to review the code, following a series of good practices. Some tips from these best practices (which lead to better code performance) are listed in the [General tips](#general-tips) session.
2. Once you have ensured that your code is *well written*, it is recommended to profile your code (see [CPU profiling](#cpu-profiling) and [Memory profiling](#memory-profiling) sessions).
3. It is possible to translate the Python function to an optimized code (see [Native-speed code](#native-speed-code) session).
4. Finally, it is possible to separate the running process in several processes to be run in parallel (see [Multiprocessing](#multiprocessing)).
